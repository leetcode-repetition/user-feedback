## Reporting a Bug

When you encounter incorrect behavior or an error, please:

1. **Click “New issue”** and choose the **🐛 Bug Report** template.  
2. **Search existing issues** to see if the bug has already been reported; if so, add any new details or 👍 reactions.  
3. **Fill in all sections** of the bug template, including:  
   * **What is the bug?** – A clear description of the problem.  
   * **How can one reproduce the bug?** – Exact clicks or commands to trigger it.  
   * **What is the expected behavior?** – What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.  
   * **What is your host/environment?** – OS, browser version, and extension version.  
   * **Do you have any screenshots?** – Helpful visuals, if applicable.  
4. **Submit**—we’ll triage, label, and assign it based on severity.

## Templates

We’ve configured two templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` so you can file the right kind of feedback every time:

* **bug-report.md** – Bug reports  
* **feature-request.md** – Feature ideas  

Templates ensure you include all necessary details up front, improving turnaround and clarity.

## Labels

We use standardized labels to organize and prioritize issues:

| Label         | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`         | Confirmed software bugs or errors            |
| `enhancement` | New feature requests or improvements         |
| `question`    | General questions or clarifications          |
| `help wanted` | Good first issues for contributors           |

Filter by label when searching to find relevant threads quickly.
